3. I first sum 4*25 to make 100 in register-0, i then use the remaining 25 in register-1 and another 25 in register 2 to sum them and make 50 in register-1, which will be the amount of odd memory writes i need to make. I the increase register-0 by one in order to have the correct location for the first memory write. I then enter the loop where i first check if my counter register-3 (initially 0) is equal to the total register-1 (EFLAGS will be 1 if this is true and exit the loop by not jumping -5) and then write the curerent value of register-0 into the location im memory corresponding with the value in it (which will always be the same). I then increase register-0 twice and register-3 once.
